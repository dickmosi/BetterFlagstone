This mod simply decreases the material cost and work cost of the Flagstone tiles to properly set them apart from Stone Tiles, overall making flagstone tiles less pointless. Deconstructing Flagstone tiles still yield no resources.

My intentions are to set the flagstone apart from the superior stone tiles and to have them suit their description a little more by making them more viable for outdoor walkways and even roads. I felt that the flagstone was very poor deal when compared to stone tiles, the only benefit being a new texture and that it could be built roughly twice as fast all whilst costing the same as stone tiles and providing no beauty and doesn't yield any resources on deconstruction.

FAQ
Q: Can I add this to an existing save?
A: Yes.

Q: Can I remove this from an existing save?
A: Yes.

Q: Does deconstructing flagstone tiles now yield resources?
A: Nope.

Q: Is this compatible with [INSERT MOD HERE]?
A: It won't break anything, but if said mod adds a new stone type or type of flagstone it will not decrease the material cost of the new flagstone tiles, it'll only decrease the work cost if the modded tiles use the same base as the Vanilla flagstone tiles. I don't plan on adding any mod compatibility in that sense as I'm more of a vanilla player.
